                        <h3>Instructions for use</h3>
                        <p>Your UniLED light comes with 3 switch positions: DC, OFF, AC</p>
                        <p><strong>DC Position</strong></p>
                        <p>The bulb uses battery power, and works as an LED torch.  Extend the handle to ensure a comfortable grip.</p>
                        <p><strong>OFF Position</strong></p>
                        <p>The bulb is switched off.  Charging, will occur in this position.</p>
                        <p><strong>AC Position (Wall Switch Control Mode)</strong></p>
                        <p>The bulb responds to on-and-off triggering of your existing source switch (wall switch or lamp switch) irrespective of whether the mains power has been disconnected, as during load-shedding or deliberate intervention for power-saving purposes.</p>
                        <p><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p>
                        <p>The resilient flame-retardant ABS outer shell and PC cover fitting ensure optimal operation within a high range of termperatures(frost cover >85%).</p>
                        <ul>
